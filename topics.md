### data
- dataset description
- type and aim of analysis
- correlations (dealing with multicollinearity)
- boxplots (distributions)

## full model 
- logistic regression:
    - odds ratios interpretation
- finding optimal threshold:
    - why and how to look for it
    - how we choose it
- performance on test

## model selection
- vif
- forward stepwise method

## restricted model
- logistic regression
- performances' comparison (full vs restricted)

## outliers detection
- cook's distance
- dffits

## outliers free model
- outliers free regression
- coefficients' comparison (outliers vs outliers free)
- performance on test
- ROC curve

## bagging
- resulting improved performance
